Even though there is a wonderful TikZ macro package outthere, sometimes you
just can't use it, because your coauthors do not like macros, really like
the language to be fixed once and for all.

Then, you may have consider a different approach (especially if pictures
you need draw are in fact quite simple and in black-and-white) -- generate
the plain LaTeX picture environment code with help of some other language.

This is precisely, what this little package does (or, rather, will do in the future)
